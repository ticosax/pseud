Features
________

    - Add reliable authentication (thx to zmq_msg_gets())
      We can now reliably know who is sending messages, this feature is required
      with an authentication backend that use the zap handler.
      Just PLAIN, and CURVE can do the job.
    - Add support for async context manager interface:
    - rely on PROBE_ROUTER socket option to let clients register themselves (instead of relying on heartbeat backend).

.. code-block:: python

    async with server:
        # do something
        ...
    # socket is closed


Breaking Changes
----------------
    - Only python3.6+ is supported
    - Only asyncio is supported (tornado and gevent are dropped)

.. note::

   This break backward compatibility.
   Interfaces are renewed and internal API is modified.
   It is not longer possible to hardcode socket's routing_id for clients.

.. note::

    pseud requires at least pyzmq 14.4.0 + libzmq-4.1.0 with ``zmq_msg_gets()``
